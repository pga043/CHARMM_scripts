* Calculating rmsf for the ligands compared to minimized structure
* during lambda dynamics simulation
*FILENAME: rmsf-residue.str
*PURPOSE: average atomic RMS fluctuations (around average structure from trajectory)
* per residue for protein non hydrogen atoms
*AUTHOR: Lennart Nilsson, Karolinska Institutet (October 8, 2003)

!ASSUMPTIONS:
! Only the relevant segment is present (no solvent, ions,...)
! A "COOR DYNA" COMMAND has been executed prior to running this script
! in order to get the relevant fluctuations into the wmain array,
! eg (where only the protein segment will be used, and we also orient to remove
! unwanted overall rotation/translation):
!! NB: Both selections are needed, and the orient has to be first!!
! coor dyna <traj-spec> orient sele segid prot end sele segid prot end
! dele atom sele .not. segid prot end ! this removes all but the protein
! Unit 21 is open for formatted write to the file where the result is written
! CHARMM variable R1 set to the (numerical!) resid of the first residue
! NB: standard top_all22_na atom names are assumed for the backbone atoms
!RESULT:
! This file calculates nucleotide averaged RMS fluctuations
! The average rmsf for the whole residue, backbone and sidechainis written to unit 21
! N- and C-terminal atoms are included with the sidchains
! Bomblev is set to -1 to avoid stopping on empty selections (Gly has no sidechain)
!LOCAL VARIABLES:
! R, RALL,RBACK,RSIDE,I,N
! Uses scalar storage arrays 3,4,5,6
! Defines selections HEAVY and BACKBONE
